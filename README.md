<h2> Description </h2>
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the **AirBnB clone**.
The aim of the project is to deploy a replica of the [Airbnb Website](https://www.airbnb.com/) using my server. The final version of this project will have:
- ```A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like a shell (for development and debugging)```
- ```A website (front-end) with static and dynamic functionalities```
- ```A comprehensive database to manage the backend functionalities```
- ```An API that provides a communication interface between the front and backend of the system.```

| **create** | Creates a new instance of the class passed by argument. | `create <class_name>` |
| **show**   | Prints the string representation of an instance. | `show <class_name> <object_id>; <class_name>.show(<object_id>)()` |
| **destroy**| Deletes an instance that was already created. | `destroy <class_name> <object_id>; <class_name>.destroy(<object_id>)()` |
| **all**    | Prints string representation of all instances or of all instances of a specified class. | `all <class_name>; <class_name>.all()` |
| **update** | Updates an instance attribute if exists otherwise create it. | `update <class_name> <object_id> <attribute name> "<attribute value>"; <class_name>.update(<object_id>, <attribute name>, <attribute value>); <class_name>.update(<object_id>, <dictionary representation>)` |
| **help**   | Show all commands or display information about a specific command. | `help; help <command_name>` |
